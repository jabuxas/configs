* welcome to my home (quite literally)

- here you will find configs for my desktop and my laptop.

- i primarily use [[https://github.com/jabuxas/nvim.config][neovim]], tmux ([[https://github.com/jrmoulton/tmux-sessionizer][sessionizer]]) and sway

- themes +are+ were completely interchangeable as long as you setup the structure of files the same as this repo, they aren't really anymore because most screenshots are from when I used hyprland and they might not work anymore, idk.

- on sway I do have now switch between dark/light, and that's all i'll add, i had way too many themes before.
